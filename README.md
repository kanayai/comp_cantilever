# comp_cantilever

Simple cantilever problem of a 5 layer composite problem, clamped one end, loading self-weight.

3D elasticity problem, 4000 nodes, 3159 8 node elements.

In this example input variables are ply angles, outputs are full field solution.

Can easily be changed to material properties as inputs and particular strains on top surface for making a Bayesian UQ problem.

Run code main will build 10 snapshots.
